  The BigFraction class was an expansion of the Fraction class from the Class 6 lab. This lab was created by SamR and completed by myself and Chloe Kelly.

Resources:
  Class 6 Fraction lab -- I used code written during the lab while building the BigFraction class.
  java BigInteger class documentation -- I referenced this documentation while building the BigFraction class.
  java String class documentation -- I used several functions from the String class, including while building the BigFraction(String) constructor. 
  java Character class documentation -- I referenced the Character class while working on the store method.
  StackOverflow -- I referenced StackOverflow for minor snags, such as formatting the user input loop in InteractiveCalculator.
